Recognizing contributors, sponsors, and partners
################################################

Background information
**********************

The Mautic Community wishes to encourage initiative/team/working group teams to acknowledge and thank their sponsors and contributors, but without the :xref:`Mautic website` properties or the Mautic application becoming overly cluttered with advertising or promotional messages.

.. vale off

Additionally, the community ensures that companies don't 'game' the system by providing minimal contributions to be recognized, for example, with logo placement or links.

.. vale on

Recognizing that the community norms around such messages are continually changing and that it's probably impossible to codify a process precisely, the recommendation is that Mautic establishes a policy framework for the Community Leadership Team to use when evaluating each situation and leave the final decisions in the case of any disputes to the Community Council.

**Contributor**: there are many ways to contribute to Mautic projects, including committing code, writing thorough bug reports, assisting with documentation, participating in community outreach, funding developers, or working on the project, among other options. Even organizations and individuals that are “merely” adopting Mautic can be extremely useful contributors if they provide good, detailed, and timely feedback about requirements and bugs.

.. vale on

**Individual Contributor**: a contributor who is a person.

**Organization Contributor**: an organization that employs one or more people who are contributors.

**Significant Contribution**: a significant contribution directly impacts the outcome of the project, not just its size. Typically, larger contributions are more significant, but that doesn't preclude an extremely valuable two-line fix to a critical but difficult-to-find bug from being "significant." Nor does it preclude a giant code dump of rarely used code from being "not significant." As a general rule of thumb, somewhere between 25% and 50% of the contributions to a project are significant.

**Current Contribution**: a current contribution refers to one included in the latest major release cycle. For example, if the project is working on release ``4.0``, then a current contribution is a contribution whose code or effect is still significant in the ``4.0`` code base. The currency of a contribution fades with time, even if that contribution is still part of the code base. For example, bug fixes to release ``1.0`` are probably no longer "current" when the current major release is ``4.0``.

**Current Significant Contributor**: a contributor who has made one or more significant contributions that are also current contributions.

**Web resources**: including but not limited to Confluence spaces, :xref:`Mautic website`'s pages, and :xref:`Community Handbook`'s pages.

**Sponsor**: an organization or individual who is financially supporting the Mautic Community regularly, listed on the :xref:`Mautic Sponsor` page.

**Partner**: an organization that's financially and practically supporting the Mautic Community regularly and has met the criteria to become a Mautic Partner, listed on the :xref:`Mautic Partners` page.

Policy on the promotion of contributors
***************************************

The Mautic policy on recognizing contributions on the :xref:`Mautic website`, in the Mautic application, and releases is as follows:

.. vale off

#. Contributions to Mautic exclude the contributor's name or affiliation in the application or code. For example, any themes contributed identify the author as ‘Mautic Team’ instead of an individual or organizational contributor.
#. Mautic recognizes contributors through the All Contributors bot on GitHub, provided they have a GitHub account. Additionally, Mautic can add contributions without a pull request. The bot is enabled across all :xref:`Mautic repositories`, and Mautic soon compiles all contributors into a single list.
#. All conversations about which contributions are recognized as significant by the initiative/team/working group must occur in a public location, such as Slack, GitHub, or the Community Forums.
#. Team meetings in the Product Team Slack channel are preferred, but publicly posted meeting minutes may be acceptable, provided they clearly document any conversations about the suitability of any contribution, including both pros and cons, as well as the +1/0/-1 position of all meeting participants.
#. Each initiative/team/working group is encouraged to list and update its current significant contributors - both individuals and organizations - on its web resources. If more than 50% of the work for an initiative, feature, or project has been carried out and/or funded by an organization contributor, it may be communicated as "sponsored by" in communications where appropriate. This can include their logo and/or link to their homepage.
#. Current significant contributors can be listed by name and photo or corporate logo as applicable or, at the initiative/team/working group's discretion, by name only. All contributors should have the opportunity to be acknowledged in the same way, and they also should have the option to remain anonymous. For example, they may refer to themselves as "Developer from Organization," use an avatar instead of a photo or choose not to be publicly listed if they prefer their contribution to remain less public.
#. Each initiative/team/working group that's recognizing or promoting the work from current significant contributors in a release must state that it's doing so as part of each release planning meeting. They must also deliver the list of contributors that need to be recognized to the Release Leader at least one week before the GA release date.
#. Each initiative/team/working group's leadership chain - leads and assistant leads - is responsible for vetting and potentially filtering the current significant contributor list to align with the overall goal and community norms of this policy.
#. Individuals or companies who believe they're being unfairly precluded from being recognized as a current significant contributor can contact the Project Lead to discuss and, where appropriate, resolve the issue.
#. Individuals or companies so recognized may promote that fact, publish that they have been recognized, and link to the recognition. Such an individual or company may not, however, imply any endorsement of their products or services by Mautic or others based on such recognition.
#. The Project Lead and Community Council reserve the right to remove any recognition at any time at their discretion.

Policy on promotion of sponsors and partners
********************************************

The Mautic policy on recognizing sponsors and partners on the :xref:`Mautic website`, in the Mautic application, and releases is as follows:

.. vale off

#. Sponsors who are contributing over $100/month have their logo and link listed on the :xref:`Mautic Sponsor` page for the duration of their active sponsorship.
#. Sponsors who are contributing under $100/month have their name or organization name listed on the :xref:`Mautic Sponsor` page.
#. Infrastructure sponsors who provide a service used by the Mautic Community at a free or discounted rate have their logo and a link to the most relevant page on their website listed on the :xref:`Mautic Sponsor` page for as long as their membership is active.
#. If a sponsor cancels their sponsorship or the service is no longer being used, Mautic removes the link as soon as notification of cancellation is received.
#. An event sponsor is listed on the event websites and won't be eligible to be listed on the :xref:`Mautic Sponsor` page unless they're a regular monthly sponsor in addition to supporting the event.
#. Partners are announced on social media and email when they become partners, announcing their joining of the program.
#. Partners are featured in the email template of the Mautic Community Newsletter with their logo and a link to their landing page.
#. The top three partners are listed on the :xref:`Mautic website`'s homepage each month, with a link to their landing page.
