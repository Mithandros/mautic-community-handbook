Introduction
============

The Mautic website serves as a hub for the Mautic community, showcasing innovative projects that align with the mission and values. The purpose of this policy is to provide clarity on the criteria and process for listing projects and integrations on the Mautic website's home page.

Criteria for inclusion
======================


A Mautic member must propose projects featured in the Mautic Integrations Directory via the :xref:`Community Portal`. Integrations must receive at least five community votes and gain endorsement from the Marketing Team for inclusion.

The projects listed on the Mautic website home page are selected based on their popularity and relevance to Mautic users, which is accomplished with a quarterly vote on the Community Portal of all eligible integrations. Members of Mautic are eligible to vote.

#. Use Cases:

   * The community prioritizes projects that clearly align with Mautic's use cases and goals.
  
   * The Marketing Team assesses how well a project addresses the needs of Mautic users and enhances their experience.
  
#. Members:
   
   * The community prioritizes projects owned by Mautic members over those that are not.

Maintenance responsibilities
============================

The maintenance of projects listed on the Mautic website home page is the responsibility of the Marketing Team. This ensures consistency, accuracy, and a seamless experience for visitors.

#. Content Updates:

   * The Marketing Team regularly reviews and updates project information to reflect current status, features, and relevant changes

   * Project maintainers are encouraged to communicate updates to the Marketing Team for timely inclusion.
  
#. Removal of Inactive Projects:

   * Inactive projects, or those no longer aligning with Mautic's goals, may be removed from the home page to maintain relevance.
  
   * The Marketing Team communicates with project maintainers before removal, providing an opportunity for clarification or updates.

Priority for open source projects
=================================

Projects with an open source nature are given priority for listing on the Mautic website home page. Open source aligns with the collaborative and community-driven spirit of Mautic. However, projects from official :xref:`Mautic Partners` may also be considered based on their significance and value to the Mautic ecosystem.

#. Open Source Priority:

   * Open source projects are favored for inclusion due to their accessibility, transparency, and collaborative nature.
   
   * The Marketing Team encourages the community to actively contribute to Open Source projects.
  
#. Partner Projects:

   * Projects from official Mautic Partners may be considered, even if not open source, if they provide substantial value to the Mautic community.

   * The community evaluates partner project inclusion on a case-by-case basis, focusing on mutual benefit.
